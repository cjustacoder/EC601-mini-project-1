# work-for-EC601
Let's make the most simple instruction in case of that I'm running out of time.
## How to run this project
1. First you should create a folder and download all the files in this project into this folder;
2. Put your Google cloud credential(the json file) into this this folder;
3. Creat a text file in this folder and copy your twitter credential into this file 
make sure that you paste your keys and token with the following format:
```javascript
(API key)
(API secret key)
(Access token)
(Access token secret)
```
make sure that you copy and paste, only paste your those four strings to each line as the same order in the file, without anything else, including space;
4. Edit 'start_here.bat', replace the name to your google credential file name behind the "=", without space, as following;
```javascript
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=My Project 27058-f61d3c8b09ce.json
```
5. Edit 'myprojectcode.py', go to the line 271, replace the name of twitter credential file(created in step.3) to yours;
6. Run the whole program by run the 'start_here.bat';
7. You may enter any argument you want when system ask you, but to test the project and make sure it works, I suggest that you can always press the "Enter"key to use my default value;
8. I will show you the result and the process of running my code, so if there is any problem with my code, please send Issues to me, thanks;
